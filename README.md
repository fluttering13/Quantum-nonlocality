# Quantum-nonlocality

One of the most striking manifestations of quantum entanglement lies in its ability to produce correlations that violate a Bell inequality [Bel64] even when measurements are carried out space-like separated. A precursor to this discovery was first discussed in the famous paper of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen in 1935. Later, in 1964, Bell showed that some correlations allowed in quantum mechanics are impossible in local hidden variable theories.

These nonlocal quantum correlations, represented by joint probability distribution of each partiesâ€™ outcomes conditioned on their choice of measurement, are known to serve as an the indispensable resource for device-independent (DI) quantum information processing
[Sca15]. An important goal here is to distinguish them from classical resources. Operationally, such correlations between measurement outcomes cannot be explained by a local common cause [Bel04], or equivalently, by shared randomness alone.
