One of the most striking manifestations of quantum entanglement lies in its ability to produce correlations that violate a Bell inequality [Bel64] even when measurements are carried out space-like separated. A precursor to this discovery was first discussed in the famous paper of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen in 1935. Later, in 1964, Bell showed that some correlations allowed in quantum mechanics are impossible in local hidden variable theories.

These nonlocal quantum correlations, represented by joint probability distribution of each parties’ outcomes conditioned on their choice of measurement, are known to serve as an the indispensable resource for device-independent (DI) quantum information processing
[Sca15]. An important goal here is to distinguish them from classical resources. Operationally, such correlations between measurement outcomes cannot be explained by a local common cause [Bel04], or equivalently, by shared randomness alone.

In recent years, the development of quantum technology has progressed rapidly. One of the significant breakthroughs is quantum supremacy [AAB+19]. In 2019, Google proudly announced the first demonstration of a quantum computational advantage compared to classical computations. In some sense, the development of quantum information theory can be traced back to Bell’s discovery in 1964. As mentioned previously, a Bell experiment can be used to demonstrate that some quantum correlations cannot be reproduced by any local causal model. This leads to new questions concerning the essential features of quantum theory. In particular, people have been trying to understand the ways in which quantum theory is different from classical theory.
